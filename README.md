## Disclaimer

Cutter is not aimed at existing radare2 users. It instead focuses on those whose are not yet radare2 users because of the learning curve, because they don't like CLI applications or because of the difficulty/instability of radare2.

## Installing

### Downloading a release

You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/radareorg/cutter/releases).

### Building from source

#### Requirements

Cutter is based on Qt so you will need to have it installed.
- Download: [Qt Open Source](https://info.qt.io/download-qt-for-application-development)
- Add Qt 5.9.1: http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-qmake.html
    
#### Building

First you must clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/radareorg/cutter
cd cutter
```

##### Building radare2
**/!\ WARNING /!\ This will delete your current radare2 version if any already installed.**
```sh
git submodule init radare2 && git submodule update radare2
cd radare2 && ./sys/install.sh
cd ..
```

##### Building cutter

Cutter can be build with two methods: The preferred one is with qmake, but you can also compile it with cmake. Choose the one you want to use.

- Method 1: Qmake
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ../src
make
```

- Method 2: CMake
```sh
cd src
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Then run cutter: `./cutter` or `./build/cutter`

Note: If radare2 is not installed system-wide (`./sys/user.sh` installation for instance) you might want to use  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/bin/prefix/radare2/lib ./cutter` to run cutter.


## Troubleshooting

On Mac, QT5 apps fail to build on QtCreator if you have the libjpeg lib installed with brew. Run this command to workaround the issue:

	sudo mv /usr/local/lib/libjpeg.dylib /usr/local/lib/libjpeg.dylib.not-found
	
If you encounter the `Project ERROR: r_core development package not found` try this command instead `PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/bin/prefix/radare2/lib/pkgconfig qmake`

## Platforms

Cutter is developed on OS X, Linux and Windows. The first release for users will include installers for all three platforms.
